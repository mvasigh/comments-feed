## Comments Feed

A small example of a comment feed that updates in real-time by long-polling the server. The front-end of this application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Getting started

To run this application locally, you must have a recent Node.js version installed. Install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the server and the client together in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run test:ci`

Launches the test runner in continuous integration mode and prints a coverage report.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run start`

Starts the Express server, serving the built static files at the index route.<br />
Run `npm run build` prior to running this script to build and serve the app in production mode.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
